                    Options are financial derivatives that grant buyers the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price. Accurate options pricing is crucial for developing effective hedging strategies, assessing potential risks, and protecting portfolios against adverse market movements. Additionally, it creates profit opportunities by identifying mispriced options in the market. However, due to market unpredictability and the complex, non-linear relationships between features, accurately pricing options remains a significant and challenging problem.

                    The <span className="text-accent font-bold">Black-Scholes model (BSM)</span>, is a traditionally used mathematical option pricing framework, and relies on several key assumptionsâ€”constant volatility, a log-normal distribution of asset returns, and constant interest rates. These assumptions rarely hold true in real-world markets, limiting the model&apos;s ability to generalize effectively.

                    The inherent complexity of non-linear feature interactions in options pricing provides an opportunity to leverage machine learning (ML) models for better predictions.

                        Developing this model was my key contribution. Initially, a <span className="text-accent font-bold">&apos;Single-Stage ANN&apos;</span> was implemented with two hidden layers (64 and 32 nodes) and an output node for price prediction. However, this approach suffered from overfitting due to the dataset&apos;s noise, as it included numerous untraded options recorded with a closing price of zero. These zeros skewed the model and led to poor performance, necessitating a new approach.

                    Our research demonstrated that machine learning models, particularly the hybrid ANN approach, can
                    significantly improve options pricing accuracy compared to traditional methods. By leveraging SVR, LSTM, and
                    ANN techniques, we addressed the limitations of conventional models and captured complex market dynamics. This
                    project not only enhanced pricing accuracy but also provided valuable insights into the intricate
                    relationships between various market factors and option prices, paving the way for more sophisticated
